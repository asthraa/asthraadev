I'm a software engineer who enjoys mostly working on backend & infrastructure. I really believe that software engineering is an art of problem solving. So I am not confined to one language or framework. Throughout my career, I have worked on multiple projects in Ruby/Rails, Python/Flask, PHP, Visual Basic. One thing I have realised by being a sofware engineer is that learning is a journey. I always experiment with new techonologies & frameworks by building some mini projects. Most recently I have started my jouney in Go. I really think it's an amazing programming language by Google.

Thanks for reading!
